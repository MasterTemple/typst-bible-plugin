      "41": "There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.",
      "42": "So is it with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is perishable; what is raised is imperishable.",
      "43": "It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.",
      "44": "It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.",
      "45": "Thus it is written, \u201cThe first man Adam became a living being\u201d; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.",

      "50": "I tell you this, brothers: flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.",
      "51": "Behold! I tell you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,",
      "52": "in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall be changed.",
      "53": "For this perishable body must put on the imperishable, and this mortal body must put on immortality.",
